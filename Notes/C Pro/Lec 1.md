## Overview of functionality of a computer

![[Lec 1 2022-11-03 10.05.58.excalidraw]]

BIOS (Basic Input Output System) is non volatile flash memory. It always stays in the RAM. When a computer turns on, it loads the operating system onto the RAM as well. The OS loads the programs into the RAM. The CPU communicates with the memory controller through the system bus, **fetch**es the instructions, **decode**s it and **execute**s it to get the output. 

CPU can only access address of byte, not a bit (Abstraction).

## Conversions

* Bits $\in$ {0, 1}
* 1 Byte = 8 Bits
* 1 KB = 1024 Bytes
* 1 MB = 1024 KB
* 1 GB = 1024 MB
* 1 TB = 1024 GB
